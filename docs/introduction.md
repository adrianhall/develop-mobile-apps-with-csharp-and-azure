# Introduction

It's been over 20 years since the first iPhone was released, ushering in a new era of development.  In that time,
iOS and Android development has become a requirement for almost any client-side developers as everyone has embraced
doing more on their phones.  At the same time, the landscape of development options has grown significantly.  Previously,
mobile app development required you to know very low-level languages like C++ or Objective-C.  Even the higher-level
languages required some specialist knowledge to get the best out of the platorm.  Nowadays, developers have a plethora 
of language and framework options:

Joining the stable of traditional languages like C#, JavaScript, and Java are new languages like Dart, Swift, and 
Kotlin. There is also an increasing demand for cross-platform tools like Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), .NET MAUI and 
Flutter.  Modern app development also highly leverages the "cloud" - a set of services hosted by service providers
like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to enable you to write better apps in a shorter amount of time to meet your 
customers demands.

With this book, you will:

* Understand how to use cross-platform development tools to design and build modern mobile apps.
* Understand how Platform-as-a-Service offerings from Azure can speed up your development time.
* Learn how to build cloud-connected applications for iOS and Android.
* Understand what's involved in running a production backend service for your mobile applications.
* Learn how to leverage DevOps techniques to run a production mobile backend service.
