When you start a project, no matter how complex it is, you should be looking at what you are intending to get out of the project.  When I first started writing "the book" several years ago, I didn't have much in mind except to provide better documentation for my main open source library - Azure Mobile Apps.  After it was written and published for everyone to read, I thought it was complete.  Then developers wanted more - how did I handle app theft; how did I work with monetization services; how did I handle the latest spanner than Apple or Google had thrown at us.  In short, the book was out of date before too long.  It was still useful, but it never kept up with the evolving mobile app landscape.

Fast forward five long years, and I have taken to writing again - a v2 of the book.  A lot has changed in the last five years.  The .NET world has moved on through ASP.NET Core to .NET 6 - a unifying vision of the .NET world.  Xamarin has been replaced by MAUI as the platform for mobile development, but Avalonia and Uno are viable alternatives.  REST is no longer the only option when it comes to data access - GraphQL and gRPC are both viable alternatives.  Security and privacy are on top of mind for most developers.  Some things have remained the same, however.  Apple and Google still maintain their stranglehold on the mobile market, and the cloud providers - AWS, Azure, and Google - are the same providers as before.

This book is laid out so that it can be read straight through.  It leads you through all the concepts needed to ensure that your development environment is set up, you can build apps, and then walks through each facet of working with the cloud.  Each chapter builds on a single application so that, by the end of the book, you have an application that uses a lot of the cloud functionality that is available.  Having said that, you can jump into and out of the book as you choose.  If you want to jump ahead to a later chapter to learn about a specific aspect of development, then by all means, do.  The chapters have a starting point and an ending point so you can see the code we develop along the way.

You can navigate through the chapters using the previous and next buttons at the bottom of each page.  You can also select particular headings by using the chapter navigator on the right and you can move between pages using the navigation tree on the left.   

With that, let's get started by setting up your development environment.
